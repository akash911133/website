== Description

The "condition" stage test based on a third "resource" like a file, an api, etc..., if we can proceed the pipeline or if we must abort.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1,4",options=header]
|===
| Name | Required | Default |Description
| kind | &#10004; |-| Define the resource type used for the `spec`
| name | &#10004; |-| Small description used in message, reports, etc. 
| spec | &#10004; |-| Define resource parameters, cfr to appropriated documentation
|===

== Examples

```
# Source return v1.0.0

conditions:
  docker:
    name: "Docker Image Published on Registry"
    kind: dockerImage
    spec:
      image: "jenkinsciinfra/plugin-site-api"

# stop here because the condition doesn't pass

```

In this example, we use the dockerImage condition. According to its documentation, we are checking if the docker image 'jenkinsciinfra/plugin-site-api' with the tag 'v1.0.0' (returned from the source) exist on DockerHub. it's not the case so it stop the pipeline here
